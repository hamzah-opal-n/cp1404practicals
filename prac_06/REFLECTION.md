# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Not sure if it's a process thing, but I'm more careful with my commits, and I've already cleared my
commit messages with my lecturer, so I know I'm in the clear there.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I don't really have a fixed schedule, but I don't know if I need to change that? I just go with the flow
while keeping the enthusiastic learning attitude, and it seems to be working just fine.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Making sure I understand the concepts inside and out before attempting any of the work.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Do more practices on paper. I want to brush up before the exam.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Honestly? Please keep the degree and diploma students separate, especially for stuff
involving group projects (Design Thinking I moment...)
