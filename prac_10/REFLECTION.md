# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I tended to overestimate the amount of time I took, but that can be chalked up to lack of
confidence in my abilities.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It roughly remained the same, except for one of the final estimates where I ended up underestimating
the time taken for the task.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that I need to pay more attention to the time taken to do these tasks, while also
gaining more control over my own focus. My focus tends to be quite binary, I'm either all in or
completely dazed. Even during personal projects, I tend to surprise myself by completing tasks extremely
quickly despite estimating that they would take a much longer time.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have learnt that it's important to get the feedback and perspectives of others as they can help spot
issues or potential improvements that you might have otherwise missed.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I have learnt that different people have different interpretations of the same solution, and they
are still viable. It's interesting to see the different ways people arrive at the same outcome.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[A review for Practical 05](https://github.com/jmoci/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

I was very thorough when looking through each file, and pointed out/questioned areas that could be improved, rather than
saying those areas were somehow "wrong".

### Good Code Review 2

[A review for Practical 06](https://github.com/cheyenneIT22/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

As before, I used the same general approach, focusing on highlighting improvement while at the end, complimenting the
developer on their work, thus giving off a friendly tone.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I think I would have added one more Kivy practical, or at least more exercises to teach us more helpful tricks and skills
(especially for the assignment).

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I did a great job with following the instructions and ensuring I met all the requirements. In particular,
Git/Version Control was a new concept for me and I got the hand of it after being a bit unsure of how to use it.
In general, I applied my personal learning style of "trying again until you understand it intuitively" and once again,
it has helped me immensely.
