# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

About 95% I think? I've also watched some videos multiple times.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I don't really have a specific schedule to watch the videos. As long as I watch them and
understand the material before the next lesson. I tend to watch them all (or at least most)
in one sitting, usually at home but sometimes elsewhere if I don't have anything to do. I
take breaks if needed.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watching the videos, making sure I understand the material, clarifying misconceptions.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to be more confident with my solutions, and make sure I'm in the clear before committing.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Struggling to figure out good commit messages and comments, as well as when to commit.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Keeping up with deadlines and understanding the requirements of each task.
